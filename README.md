# Charging-Port-Detector
Charging Port Detector | CV based control of socket latch into port
Prepared and annotated a novel Dataset of 272 Charging Ports images and Rotated ports (about Z-axis) images.
Applied Object Detection Algorithm YOLOv7 on novel dataset containing CCS1 and CCS2 charging ports images
Handled rotation about the z-axis by training CNN Network VGG-16 on a novel dataset of rotated CCS1 and CCS2
ports and utilized Monocular Depth Estimation for handling rotation about the x and y axes
Performed model testing on Real-world Video Data
Exposure - Pytorch, CNN Architectures, DataSet Preparation, Image preprocessing and augmentation
